How to install:

  Put the Serpent.tmLanguage in the following directory:

  Note: You probably don't have the 'Serpent' directory under the paths below, you should create the 'Serpent'         directory first.

  Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2/Packages/Serpent/

  OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Serpent/

  Linux: ~/.Sublime Text 2/Packages/Serpent/

  After installation, when you open a .srp file with sublime text, it will automatically choose Serpent syntax.

Known issues:

Although the colon to declare the start of an indented block in Serpent is optional, the syntax file can only work without the colon.
